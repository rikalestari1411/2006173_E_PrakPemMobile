    title: "Gorengan | Tradisional Snack From Indonesia",
    description:
        "Gorengan is a generic name that refers to a wide group of Indonesian deep-fried snacks that can be prepared with a variety of ingredients. Whether savory or sweet, the fritters usually combine egg batter with various additions such as bananas, tempeh, tofu, sweet potatoes, or jackfruit. The ingredients can be finely sliced and incorporated into the batter or merely dipped before they are fried. Gorengan is one of the most common Indonesian street food items that is sold at numerous markets throughout the country. Although they come in a seemingly endless number of combinations, some of the most popular varieties include pisang goreng (bananas), ubi goreng (sweet potato), aci goreng (fried tapioca dough), tahu goreng (fried tofu), and singkong goreng (fried cassava)..",

    title: "Indonesian Chicken Satay | Coconut and Spice",
    description:
        "This is a recipe for skewered, tender, marinated-chicken pieces grilled to perfection and served with a rich, flavorful, lime-infused spicy peanut sauce.  No wonder this dish is popular throughout Southeast Asia! In my earlier post on nasi goreng, I mentioned “if every country has a national dish, Nasi Goreng is hands-down, Indonesia’s dish.”  It just so happens, I confirmed in Wikipedia earlier today that nasi goreng indeed is Indonesia’s national dish. In fact, besides nasi goreng, there are 4 other dishes that were chosen by the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy in 2018. Guess what? Sate Ayam (Chicken Satay) also made the list. .",
